    <h2>What I Liked</h2>

      Of all the films I have seen over the years, The Shawshank Redemption may
      be the best at toying with your emotions. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll
      get angry, you’ll even get disgusted. However, each of these emotions are
      warranted. Unlike other films, Shawshank refrains from feeling
      manipulative or fake. In essence, you’re watching a highlight tape of Andy
      Dufresne’s life. Under less creative minds, The Shawshank Redemption could
      have felt similar to a Lifetime movie. However, while Lifetime films (and
      lesser theatrical film for that matter) tell you how to feel, Shawshank
      shows you how to feel by crafting perfect scenes that express their
      emotion in the little details. Tim Robbins, who has never been better than
      in this film, cracks a little smirk on his face and you completely
      understand all his pain, agony, and hope for the future.

      Obviously, Shawshank has more overt emotional moments as well. But, they
      only pack the punch that they do because the base was set in the quieter
      moments of the film. Another addition to the emotion comes from Morgan
      Freeman’s voice-over work throughout the film. Not only is his voice
      incredibly melodic and soothing, but it actually adds to the story in ways
      that many voice-overs have failed to replicate. Keeping up with the idea
      of showing and not telling, Freeman discusses the who, where, when, and
      (most importantly) the why instead of the what. The voice-over actually
      adds to each scene, providing for an improved context for each character
      while also allowing a more resonant emotional experience.

      The emotion continues with the gorgeous music composed by Thomas Newman.
      Like I mentioned in my review of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of
      the Black Pearl, the mark of a truly great score comes with its
      recognizability and how it accents the frames onscreen. Not only is it
      just absolutely beautiful, it perfectly heightens the feel of every single
      scene. People fail to realize how much a score can influence their
      thoughts towards a film. When the score swells at just the right moment,
      you can easily be brought to tears when paired with a powerful scene.

      All these discussion points are great, but what really allows for The
      Shawshank Redemption to flourish is its realization of the idea of hope.
      While you may feel blue, there’s an ever-presenting feeling of light at
      the end of the tunnel. This is one of the main reasons for The Shawshank
      Redemption‘s watchability time and time again. It’s a difficult maneuver
      to accomplish. Weaving through dark tones while keeping the idea of hope
      alive could cause some serious tonal issues. If done incorrectly, it can
      confuse the audience by sending conflicting feelings. A scene that tells
      you to feel hopeful but act hopeless could even become laughable. But
      thanks to Frank Darabont and company, they account for the best parts of
      the film. shawshank redemptionimage via Business Insider Many movies would
      stay away from this combination altogether. This is precisely what makes
      Shawshank original and, above all else, sincere.
