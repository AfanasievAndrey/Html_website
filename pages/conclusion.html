    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
           In the end, The Shawshank Redemption does what any movie should do: make
      its audience emotionally invested in the story all the while having some
      beautiful themes underneath the surface. Naturally, it gets an A+. It’ll
      bring a smile to your face, and that’s more than a lot of movies can say
      these days. It’s certainly worth a top spot on the IMDB Top 250 list.
