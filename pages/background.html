         The Shawshank Redemption is directed by Frank Darabont and stars
      well-known actors such as Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. After being
      convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover, Andy Dufresne (Robbins)
      is sent to life in prison at the Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine.
      While there, Andy begins to ingratiate himself with a group of inmates led
      by Red (Freeman). Although over time he carves out a nice life for himself
      at the prison, he encounters countless moments of opposition led by the
      warden (Robert Gunton) and the lead guard (Clancy Brown).

          Although it has since experienced increasing prosperity after leaving
      theaters, The Shawshank Redemption was considered by many to be bomb at
      the box office as it failed to recover its production budget. Many
      higher-ups at Castle Rock Entertainment cited a lukewarm review in the Los
      Angeles Times as one of the main culprits against the film’s initial
      financial success. However, as you probably know, the movie has since
      improved its popularity and financial standing since its release onto
      television. This maneuver was made possible after Ted Turner purchased
      Castle Rock Entertainment. Since Turner then owned Castle Rock (and by
      proxy The Shawshank Redemption), it allowed for TNT to air the film at
      very low costs while still charging premium advertisement prices to
      companies. Rights retainers of films earn practically all of the TV
      revenue for films. This fact makes The Shawshank Redemption‘s success
      increasingly lucrative for Ted Turner. shawshank redemptionimage via
      IFC.com We can all agree that the film wouldn’t be as financially
      successful on television without being such a hit with fans and critics,
      but what traits allow for the film to continue to rake in the dough?
